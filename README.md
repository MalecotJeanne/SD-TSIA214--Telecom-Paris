### Objectives
Text mining is a progressing and challenging domain. For example, a lot of efforts have been recently dedicated to the development of methods able to analyze opinion data available on the social Web. The first objective of this course is to tackle the different methods of language processing and machine learning underlying text and opinion mining.

### Techniques and concepts studied :
- natural language pre-processing : tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, document representation and word embeddings techniques
- natural language resources : lexicons, wordnet and framenet
- text clustering and text categorization : advanced machine learning methods such as deep learning, non-negative matrix factorization, hidden markov models, etc.
